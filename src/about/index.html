                                        Life in Christ Community Church was founded on
                                        20th of
                                        October 2024 with the purpose
                                        of glorifying the triune God of the Bible through the promotion of His worship,
                                        the
                                        proclaiming of the Gospel, and the edification of the believers.
                                        We recognize Jesus Christ as our Lord and Saviour and as the Head of the Church.
                                        Therefore His Word is our final authority and our only true and infallible rule
                                        of
                                        all saving knowledge, faith, and obedience.
                                        However, we are also a confessional church, since we recognize the need to
                                        systematize the biblical teachings so that we can give a comprehensive
                                        expression of
                                        what we believe the Word of God teaches.

                                        Baptist Confession of Faith of 1689 is a faithful expression of the set of

                                        Our Mission is to worship God both together as a church and individually as
                                        redeemed believers, ministering the Word in dependence on the Holy Spirit.
                                        Additionally, we aim to grow towards Christian maturity and spread the Gospel
                                        —the Good News of Jesus Christ— throughout The Netherlands.

                                                very God and very man, yet without sin (Luke 1:35; Romans 9:5;

                                                incarnation,
                                                Jesus did not lose any of His divine attributes, but only restricted the

                                                of some of them, according to the will of the Father (Philippians

                                                Corinthians 5:21). Jesus Christ voluntarily offered Himself to be

                                                known the wisdom of God. The Church is the pillar and ground of the

                                                (Matthew 28:18-20; Ephesians 3:10-11; 1 Timothy 3:15; Revelation 5:9).

                                                new life (Romans 6:1-11). Each believer must be baptized voluntarily as

                                                Ephesians 2:8-9). Baptism is also a sign of fellowship and
                                                identification
                                                with the visible Body of Christ (Acts 2:41-42).

                                                Based on
